MyBB Mobile is an app boilerplate for myBB forum owners to create their own Android app for their forums. The app supports all features that come packaged in the default myBB configuration, as well as 3rd-party plugins for reputation and usergroups.

The app is built on top of a headless browser, which scrapes raw HTML from your page and parses it using the JSoup library. No API is needed for the app to function.
